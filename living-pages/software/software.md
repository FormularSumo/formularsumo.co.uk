A list of the software I use and why. Generally the higher up something is in a category, the more I use it. I've also tried to list the supported platforms - I prefer software which is crossplatform.

*Note: If something says "Google Android", this means it's only (officially) available on Android devices with Google Play Services installed.*

## Maps

{% details "CoMaps", "Android, iOS, Linux" %}

I use CoMaps for most of my mapping needs. It's an offline-first, private, free and open-source (FOSS) app based on OpenStreetMaps data and transparently run by a non-profit. It's incredibly lightweight, fast, and battery-efficient, and has really good for walking and biking directions. It's also got great he map design, they're very aesthetically pleasing, while also being super detailed, including things like benches, bins, toilets, and metro entrances/paths.

The biggest drawback for me is the lack of public transport. CoMaps only works with metro systems at the moment - there's no support for buses or heavy rail. Another big issue the lack of live data. While offline-first is generally a good thing, it would be useful to be able to see eg live transport timetables, traffic, and temporary road closures.
