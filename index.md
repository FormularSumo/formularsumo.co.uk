Hi, I'm James Heppell, a computer science student from the UK and current living in the Community of Madrid. I'm interested in a lot of areas of tech, both software and hardware, but especially in the intersection of our digital and physical lives. I'm a big fan of open ecosystems such as the Web, and help out with [Open Web Advocacy](https://open-web-advocacy.org).

I like playing music. Mainly sax (of which I like soprano the most), piano, and trombone, and I'll happily play in any setting from symphonic orquestras to big bands. I also have some experience conducting.

I enjoy travelling and learning about people. Languages and cultures, history, geography, and the science behind why we think, act and are how we are; our evolutionary pasts. I like writing about and otherwise sharing what I learn with anyone who's interested.

To round off this brief introduction, I love sports, more or all less all of them I've tried. For the past few years calisthenics (also known as [street workout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_workout)) has been my favourite, but other highlights include cycling (mainly mountain biking), swimming, running, and table tennis. Zumba deserves a mention too.
