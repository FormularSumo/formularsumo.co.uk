A living page is a project that's never finished, which I can improve, expand and add to at any point. Because of that, it doesn't have a publication date, and it can change a lot from its first version. The concept comes from the idea of a *digital garden*, which you can read more about here [https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/).
