    When you go to vote in the UK, you vote for 1 candidate, belonging to the party
    you like, who represents your local area, and you’d be forgiven for thinking
    that’s how it works everywhere in the world. But in fact there are
    <strong>14</strong> different systems in use <strong>today</strong>, and many
    hundreds of variations. In this article I’ll talk you through some of the most
    common. Which one is the best you ask? Well, that depends who you ask. For my
    money though, I think <a href="#single-transferable-vote">STV</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="first-past-the-post">First Past the Post</h2>
    <p>
    First Past the Post is the voting system the UK currently uses for its general
    elections. It's used in quite a lot of other countries, mostly former UK
    colonies, such as the US (which uses a variation) and India.
    </p>
    <p>
    The UK is split up into many hundreds of constituencies of roughly equal size
    (~70 000 people on average). When you vote at elections you vote for your local
    representative. You get 1 vote and 1 vote only. The candidate with the most
    votes wins and becomes the member of Parliament for your constituency.
    </p>
    <p>
    The main advantage of FPTP is that it's very easy to count votes, and everyone
    has a local representative they can talk to. The main disadvantage is that seats
    are not  completely representative of votes, especially for smaller,
    non-regional parties.

    <h2 id="party-list-proportional-representation">Party list proportional representation</h2>
    <p>
    Party list proportional representation is perhaps the most used voting system in
    the world, largely used in Europe, South America and parts of Africa, and is
    used when the UK holds elections for the European parliament.

    </p>
    <p>
    In PL-PR you vote for a party instead of, or as well as, a candidate.
    Constituencies are much bigger than in FPTP (~25 candidates), and in some cases
    (e.g. Netherlands) may be the whole country. Seats are awarded directly
    proportional to votes, and individual candidates can be chosen by parties
    (closed list) or voted on at election day (open list).
    </p>
    <p>
    The main advantage of PL-PR, is in the name: it’s as representative as it’s
    possible to get. The % of the vote you get is the % of the seats you get. The
    main disadvantage is that you may not get a local representative, and if you do
    they won’t actually be that local, as constituencies are such big areas in this
    system. PL-PR can often lead to coalitions in power, as big parties don’t get
    over-represented, which can be both a good and a bad thing (more views taken
    into account, more disagreement).
    </p>
    <h2 id="single-transferable-vote">Single Transferable Vote</h2>
    <p>
    Single transferable vote is a fairly uncommon system, used by Ireland, Malta and
    in local elections across the UK (N.I, Scotland, Wales). It aims to combine the
    proportionality of PL-PR with the local representation of FPTP, all while giving
    voters more choice. A big claim.
    </p>
    <p>
    In STV constituencies can have anywhere from 3 seats upwards. The more seats the
    more proportional, but the less local candidates are and the harder it is to
    count votes. Generally 6 strikes a good balance, and 3 is not recommended
    because of risk of gerrymandering.

    </p>
    <p>
    In an STV election you order all of the candidates. If your 1st choice is
    knocked out, your vote gets transferred to your second choice, and so on (see
    video below). This has two main advantages: one is you can choose between
    different candidates within parties, and another is you can support small
    parties which you might not otherwise vote for because you think they’re
    unlikely to win so your vote would be wasted (<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting">tactical voting</a>). MPs
    are less local, though you are more likely to have one who’s from a party you
    support. The main disadvantage of STV is how complicated it is. Sure, computers
    can do most of the counting now, but it still takes a lot longer than FPTP and
    is harder for vote counters and voters to understand.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2 id="mixed-member-proportional">Mixed Member Proportional / Additional Member System</h2>
    <p>
    While more common than STV, MMP is still a quite uncommon system, used in
    Germany & New Zealand among other places.
    </p>
    <p>
    While STV <em>aims </em>to combine FPTP with PL-PR, Mixed Member Proportional
    <em>literally </em>does. Half of the MPs are elected via a FPTP election, the
    other half of the MPs are assigned to parties in order to make them have the
    same proportion of seats for votes. For example if I got 2 seats through FPTP,
    and you got 1, but we got roughly the same amount of votes (eg 51% to 49%), 1
    seat would be awarded to me through PR, and 2 to you. Usually both the elections
    happen at the same time, on the ballot paper you would vote for a candidate
    <em>and </em>a party.
    </p>
    <p>
    The main benefit of this is seats are awarded proportionally, and you still get
    a local candidate. The disadvantage is that it’s, again, more complicated than
    FPTP.
    </p>
    <h2>Some more voting systems briefly</h2>
    <h3>Parallel voting</h3>
    <p>
    Parallel voting is similar to MMP, but different in that PR seats are awarded to
    make the PR section of the seats proportional, rather than awarded to make all
    seats proportional to the PR vote. Eg in parallel voting if I got 10% of the PR
    vote, but got awarded 0% of the seats in the FPTP vote, I’d be given 10% of the
    PR seats, 5% of the seats in total. In MMP I’d be awarded 20% of the PR seats,
    to give me 10% of the total seats. Russia, South Korea and Japan use this
    system.
    </p>
    <h3>Instant runoff voting / Alternate vote</h3>
    <p>
    AV is the same as FPTP, but you order your candidates. Lowest candidates are
    knocked out, and their votes transferred until a candidate has > 50% of the
    votes, in which case they win that seat. Australia uses this method and we had a
    referendum on whether to adopt it in 2011.
    </p>
    <h3>Two round system</h3>
    <p>
    Two round system is FPTP, but with two rounds. After the first round all
    candidates but 2 are knocked out. France uses this.
