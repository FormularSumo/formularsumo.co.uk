# How this site is made

This website is made using the [Eleventy](www.11ty.dev) static site generator. It uses progressively enhanced HTML and CSS, and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) for server-side templating.

The [source code](https://github.com/FormularSumo/formularsumo.co.uk) is hosted on GitHub, where commits are automatically built and deployed to [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The domain name is managed by [PorkBun](porkbun.com/).

I typically write new content directly in markdown into my code editor, where I can see it straight away in my browser. Sometimes, especially if I'm working on something collaboratively or if I'm adapting an older piece, I work in a word processor and then export to markdown or HTML afterwards.

You can install my website as a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), and you can also find the Atom feed on the homepage if you want to add my blog to your feed reader.

All content on the website should be accessible in any modern browser, with or without JavaScript enabled. That being said, I do like to try out new web platform features once they're available, so it's possible some non-essential functionality won't work in all browsers yet. Examples that come to mind at the time of writing are [View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_view_transitions) and [minimal-ui](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest/Reference/display#syntax:~:text=minimal%2Dui,-39).
