It's approaching the end of the year, and that means it's time for my reading list. I'm happy to report that this year - especially in the first half, I've read a lot more than in the previous one. While great news, it does mean that there's much more to write about, so this time I'm going to split the list into an English and a (much longer) Spanish part, which you can change between using the language switcher in the top right. As before, I'm planning to go chronologically, writing a short background on each book, and giving out some "highly recommended" awards.

## Oedipus Rex - Sophocles, Johnson (2005) translation

While I was studing in my year abroad in Spain, I restricted myself to only reading books in Spanish (hence why the English part of this list is relatively short), with the exception of *Oedious Rex*. I read this as part of a course I was taking, [*Cultura Clásica*](https://www.uah.es/es/estudios/estudios-oficiales/grados/asignatura/Cultura-Clasica-252012/) (Classical Cultures), for the coursework and for the exam. Being the first Ancient Greek/Roman literature I looked at, I chose to read it in English to better (and quicker) understand it. [The translation I used](http://johnstoniatexts.x10host.com/sophocles/oedipusthekinghtml.html) is a modern text, which made it much easier to parse and more enjoyable, and also came with very helpful footnotes explaining context, characters, meanings, and more.

Sophocles is one of the most celebrated of the Ancient Greek tragedians, alongside Aeschylus ("the father of tragedy") and Euripidies ("the most tragic of poets"), and *Oedipus Rex* is likely his most famous and performed work. I enjoyed it a lot, it was interesting reading something in such a different format to what I'm used to, and it tied into learning about the culture and [geography](https://formularsumo.github.io/Mapa-Interactivo-Grecia-Antigua/) of Classical Greece. Interestingly, I didn't feel as strong a sense of wanting to stop what was happening, of things going wrong, as in other fated tragedies - I think because the characters here were often harder to sympathise with. Overall though I still liked the story and the setting, and at some point I plan to read Sophocles' closely related *Oedipus at Colonus* and *Antigone*, whose events take place shortly afterwards.
