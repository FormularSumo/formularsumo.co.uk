    "The above (diesel) Mercades-Benz Citaro (2018) has a fuel efficiency of <a href='https://www.spritmonitor.de/en/detail/1035517.html?cdetail=1'>29.57 l/100km</a>, whereas the average UK diesel car is <a href='https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/average-mpg'>43 mpg</a>, or 6.6 l/100km, which is 4.5x better. Other estimates I've seen online put the figure at around 5-6x as well, so I think this is fairly typical, comparing the same times of energy (diesel/petrol/electricity)."

## Setting the scene

According to the [latest government statics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/transport-statistics-great-britain-2024/transport-statistics-great-britain-2023-domestic-travel#:~:text=TSGB0101%20and%20TSGB0102.-,Of%20the,-799%20billion%20passenger), 90% of the distance travelled in Great Britain takes place by road: 85% by private vehicles, 4% by bus and cocach, and 1% by motorbikes and pedal bikes, while the remaining tenth is made up by rail (9%) and air (1%). This is a marked change from just a century ago, and this rise in car-centric transport and lifestyle has drastically changed out movement patterns and, as I'm going to argue, has largely done so for the worse.

## Accessibility: Transport for *everyone*

Driving and owning a motor vehicle is a big responsibilty. Learning to drive is a time-consuming and expensive process, and something which is not an option for a lot of people. The young, the very old, the disabled, and many more are largely or not at all able to. Buying and maintaining a car is expensive: fuel, maintaince and MOTs, repairs, insurance, parking and road taxes nowadays combine to form British people's second largest expense after housing<sup><a id="n-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>

I've titled this article "tranport should for the public" because I strongly believe that everyone has the right to get around and to where they need to, independently and without reliance on their ability and economic provisions to drive, or on a family member or friend to do so for them. I grew up in quite a car dependent place, and I was very reliant on my parents to take me around; if they're weren't available or willing to, I often couldn't (easliy, quickly or cheaply) get to where I wanted to.

Throughout most of our human history, we've walked everywhere. Or perhaps ridden a horse, maybe with a carriage. Sometimes even a boat if we were feeling adventerous. And these are still very good ways of getting around (bicycles now included as well), but in our modern societies we go much further distances, much more often. While active transport should remain our first option for shorter trips (for those who are able to), we need engine-powered vehicles to go further. And for transport to be truly accessible and universal we need solutions which are avaiable to everyone, low-cost, quick and conveninent.

## Cars: Unsustainable in more ways than one

I've laid out the moral case for public transport - for why it's needed, but it absolutely should not just be last option, for those don't have others. It should be, with few exceptions, the first.

### Pollution

It's common knowledge that combustion engine cars are one of the most polluting forms of transport, heavily impacting both global warming and local levels of air pollution, and noise pollution too. And according to the latest UK Gov statistics, their greenhouse emissions per kilometre are second only to domestic flights, an option so unsustainable that countries such as France are taking steps to ban them<sup><a id="n-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.

<p class="caption"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/travel-carbon-footprint"><img src="carbon-footprint.svg" alt="Flights (especially short-distance) and combustion-engine cars release the most emissions, followed by motorbikes and buses, then hybrid and electric cars, mixed UK overground and underground trains, coaches, ferries and the eurostar (electric trains)"></a>Carbon equivalent per kilometre of different modes of transport</p>

It's true that hybrids and electric cars are a lot better, but they're still not great options. The vast vast majority of cars are on the road have combustion-engines and will do for quite a long time. Even at the time of writing new EVs make up only [20% of new vehicle registrations, and 4% of cars on the road](https://www.zap-map.com/ev-stats/ev-market). But if you look closely at the chart you'll notice that electric cars are actually not all that efficient. How can that be? In part because a lot of our electrcity production still comes from fossil fuels. But that's not the full picture, because options such as long-distance coaches which *do* mostly use fossil fuels are still more efficient, and local buses are significantly more efficent than petrol/diesel cars. The reason for this is that cars typically use a lot, lot more power per person. The average car trip has [1.6 people onboard](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66ce0f6f25c035a11941f655/nts0905.ods) and a maximum of 5, but an average bus trip has [11.9](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6745b86683f3d6d843be96c9/bus03.ods) and a maximum of 50-90<sup><a id="n-3" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>, while only using 4-6x as much power.<sup><a id="n-4" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. If you do the maths this means that an average bus carries around 7.5x as many people, while using roughly 5x as much energy - an improvement of 1.5x. But if you take a reasonably full bus, say 80% capacity (56.25) vs the same for a car (4), you get 14x as many people - an improvement of almost 3x. With a car, you have a lot of car body for very few people, whereas a bus has a much higher ratio of people to vehicle, and will typical get far more use before having to be replaced.

To really get the point across, national rail, which typically does stop often, produces less emissions per km than EVs and the [majority of it](https://railmap.azurewebsites.net/Public/ElectrificationMap) is *not yet electrified*. The very high efficiency of train carriges (person to vehicle body ratio) combined with the low-friction of rail and with mostly smooth journeys (no sudden breaking and acceleration, traffic or idling) makes them unbelievably efficient in terms of energy usage. The Eurostar - a fully electrified and modern train line - produces an order of magnitude less emissions than electric cars.

### Carrying capacity & infrastructure

While most people are familiar with the high levels of pollution caused by cars, their impact on space usage and subsequent effects on city designs is often less well understood. I've already alluded to their poor carrying capacity but to really put things into perspective it's helpful to see a visualisation.

<p class="caption"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/sites/cycling-embassy.org.uk/files/styles/max_resolution/public/dictionary/Capacity%20and%20road%20space.jpg?resize=900%2C551&ssl=1"><img src="transport-density.jpg" alt="Mixed traffic and especially cars have the worst carrying capacity. Cycling and walking are significantly better, as are bus lanes and light rail (trams), although heavy rail and suburban rail are the clear winners."></a>Maximum transport capacity (people) per hour on a 3.5 metre wide lane for different modes of transport</p>

Of all the common forms of transport, cars are the least efficient way of moving people. On the same sized track they carry 3-4x less people than cycling or walking and 8x less than dedicated bus lunes. Vs heavy rail and metros systems the comparison is even more stark with differences of 40-50x, notwithstanding that metros are often largely located underground anyway.

So where does this matter? Most obviously it matters in urban centres with high density housing and lots of people (commuters, tourists) moving in and out. Trying to transport hundreds of thousands or even millions of people by car in these locations would simply be impossible. As well as being worse to begin with. trying to increase car carrying capacity tends to scale significantly worse than shared transport. City planners have well versed in the concept of induced demand, where widening or building more roads generally leads to more people using the road and no improvements to traffic (or even worsening). With enough roads you *might* be able to overcome this problem, but the space and costs needed would be astronimical, as would the complexity of the system - and human drivers are not very good at using extra road space and distributing themselves well on it. Public transport meanwhile is comparatively easy to scale as needed to meet the demands of even the most populated places on Earth.

### Car-first design & dependency

The effects of car-centric transport don't just affect urban centres, and they arguably have a greater impact on the rest of the population. Over the past hundred or so years many new places - mid and small sized towns - have been built to be car-first. While older settlements have been retrofitted to adapt, and metropolises simply can't support it, these places - above all in Northamerica and the countries with the most influence from there - are desiged around cars. The end result of this is as inevitable as it is self-fufilling.

Pre-car towns and villages are designed around and for humans. Lots of amenities, attractions and places of work are located within a short walking of each other. Everything is built at a human scale - you can walk along the street and feel like you belong there, passing easily from building to building. When you needed to go between one walkable zone and another you'd take a form of collective transport such as a [tram/streetcar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram#History) or a horse and carridge. In complete contrast, places built around cars are often entirely unfriendly to humans. Buildings are spaced much further apart, and often separated by busy roads and gigantic car parks.

Historically when designing and building a place, there's always been a clear distinction between roads and streets. *Roads* are designed for transporting pepole: for going between different zones within a city and between different cities or towns. They can be general-purpose roads intended for all sorts of vehicles such as horse drawn-ones, electric trolleycars, cycles and pedestrians, and of course cars, or dedicated train lines designed for heavy rail. As seen, rail tends to be more efficient, and faster, but less flexible. Both are important to have. But once you enter a town or a zone, you'd find mostly streets. *Streets* are designed for humans. They are typically a bit smaller, and filled with all sorts of shops, attractiones, parks, public spaces and facilities. While roads are usually fairly empty, save for an occasion service station, streets are the places where people live and spend time. Forums and plazas, markets, street musicians and performers, libraries and places of study, civil buildings, works of architecture and art: streets are what make a place.

<img src="road.jpg" style="width: 49.5%">
<img src="street2.avif" style="width: 49.5%">
<p class="caption">Left: a road. Right: a street in Amsterdam</p>

The problem with car-first designs is that they blur these lines. They design streets at the scale of a road, where everything is too far apart and very unfriendly, and usually dangerous, for humans. These street-road hybrids are often called *stroads*.

<img src="stroad.avif" alt="A stroad: 5-6 car lanes in each direction with many turnings and junctions leading to highly spaced apart buildings with large car parks">
<p class="caption">A stroad in the US</p>

While it would theoretically be possible to walk to and around the above retail parks, they're clearly not designed for it. It would be incredibly dangerous to do so with the narrow or nonexistant pavements, placed near to and virutally without protection from the very busy, fast and chaotic lanes of traffic. To make a street an enjoyable place to be it both needs to be/feel safe, and to be inviting to its users: visually interesting and varied. This place and most like it is entirely barren, save for a sparce few repeating trees. I have walked around many of these and it's a really bad experience. It feels like you're completely out of place and that at any moment a car might appear out of nowhere and hit you (especially when there simply aren't pavements connecting certain parts), not to mentioned the noise and fumes. But when somewhere is designed for and at the scale of cars this is the result; anybody who's not inside a car is an outsider and the viscious cycle of car-design and car-dependency continues.

### Car-centric lifestyles & the parking problem

According to [research by the Briitsh Parking association](https://www.britishparking.co.uk/write/documents/library/reports%20and%20research/bpa_uk_parking_sector_report_awweb.pdf), there were estimated to be over 45 million parking spaces in 2013 (including private parking) - not far off 1 space per person. And [according to the RAC foundation](https://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/facts_on_parking.pdf) the average car spends 96% of its time parked, and just 4% in use. These statistics helpfully highlight the final but equally important problem with car-centric design. We've loked at how car-first designs are very inefficient at moving people around, and so take up a lot of road (or stroad) space. We've talked about how they cause buildings to become oversized and placed very far apart, while making them highly unappealing to anyone not inside of a car. But the cherry on top is that in additional to all this, cars take up space when not in use - a lot of it. If you look at a top-down view of a retail park such as the above ones, or of a typical US surburb, you'll notice that most of the space that's not road is actually used for car parking. Street-level car parks take up vast quantities of space and often take this space away from streets and other human-scale buildings. A welcoming, enticing street or public space is broken by a large car park, and providing (or even mandating) multiple parking spaces per home is a sure-fire way to guarentee car-scale designs instead of human-scale ones.

It doesn't really need stating, but shared forms of transport use much less parking space. For one because there's a lot less needed due their efficiency and shared nature, but more acutely because when you get off a bus or train, or taxi, the vehicle continues on its way to serve other people, rarely stopping during the day. When stored at night they're typically parked out of the way in a station or depot. The difference with private vehicles could hardly be greater. Yet the above RAC foundation report states there there were over 27m private cars in 2012, close to 1 per every 2 people, while the [Department for Transport estimates](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2022/national-travel-survey-2022-household-car-availability-and-trends-in-car-trips) that 78% of households have at least one car, with 34% having two or more.

<img src="household-cars.avif">

With so many people owning cars, driving them around and parking them everywhere it becomes inevitable that many places end up being designed for cars and incorportating large car parks, large roads, and non-human-friendly designs.

## Buses: stereotypes and reality

Of all the methods of transport, buses have possibly the worst reputation. While there was once a time when everyone would get the bus, ridership and service has been falling and falling, and nowadays in the UK they're often seen as only for the young, old, and poor, and this largely matches my experience of taking them. Especially outside of major cities such as London, few people take buses and 

## Rail: 

Japan - orders or magnitude more train journeys, tickets for delays otherwise not a valid work/school excuse
75% of distance travelled by train??


## Pricing: Why the correct price is free

Collective action problem

Lower costs overall - see below

We've already mentioned the spatial inefficiency of cars, but as well as taking up much more road space and increasing the distance between places they also wear away roads faster due to their increased weight and speed. [Analysis from Urban3](https://www.urbanthree.com/services/cost-of-service-analysis/) shows that these sorts of designs are by and large financially insolvent, especially in the long-term, and have to be heavily subsidised by the traditional - often run-down and poorly funded - urban centres and older parts of the town.



## When private road vehicles do make sense

Many disabilities and those with poor mobility (though often having to be driven by others)
Off-road and remote locations or times (especially taxis, eg middle of the night)
Short-distance freight and deliveries
Large item transport - instruments/theatre, moving homes

TLDR: useful, but they should not be the default option
