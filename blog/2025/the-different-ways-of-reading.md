embedAlt: An arial view of a book, a laptop-tablet, and a phone with earbuds on top of a table. The phyiscal book, Historia del Ferrocarril de España, is a hardback with ilustrations of various 19th century trains and maps with related text boxes, and it has a bookmark in it. The laptop is folded over like a tablet and displaying Oedipus At Colonus, in Firefox's reader view, with options to change the text and the page design, and to use a screen reader. The phone has the Walkable City audiobook open, with some earbuds and their case placed on top of the phone.

It's said that there's nothing like a good book - a paper book. But nowadays there's much more variety in how we read, and it would be wrong to say that reading on paper is always better, as each medium has its own advantages and drawbacks. We're currently living through a revolution in how we read, and I'd like to give a balanced view of the situation, and offer a vision for the future.

The 3 main mediums for reading are physical, digital, and oral. There's a lot of variety within these categories: an ebook vs a blog, or a school textbook vs a bestseller novel, but it's the simplest way of categorising them. I personally do a mixture of them, and I believe they all have their place, although it's true that they can be better suited to certain situations or to specific people.

Let's start with reading digitally. I think this is the least prestigious category, and I can easily understand why.
